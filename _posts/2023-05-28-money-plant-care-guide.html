    <h2 class="mt-3">The Beauty of Indoor Greenery</h2>
    <p>Before we dive into the practical care tips, take a moment to appreciate the beauty of indoor plants. They bring a touch of nature's serenity and freshness to your living space, enhancing both aesthetics and air quality.</p>
    
    <!-- Additional content goes here... -->
    
    <h2>Providing the Right Light:</h2>
    <p>Money Plants thrive in bright, indirect sunlight. Avoid exposing them to harsh, direct sunlight, especially during hot afternoons. A spot near a window with filtered light is ideal.</p>
    
    <h2>Choosing the Right Soil:</h2>
    <p>Use a well-draining, peat-based soil mixture for your Money Plant. A combination of potting soil and perlite or sand helps prevent waterlogging and promotes healthy root growth.</p>
    
    <h2>Watering Wisely:</h2>
    <p>Allow the top inch of the soil to dry out before watering your Money Plant. Overwatering can lead to root rot, so it's essential to maintain a balanced watering routine. Adjust the frequency based on your indoor conditions.</p>
    
    <h2>Maintaining Humidity:</h2>
    <p>Money Plants appreciate moderate humidity levels. If your indoor environment is dry, mist the leaves occasionally or place a water-filled tray with pebbles near the plant. As the water evaporates, it increases the humidity around the plant.</p>
    
    <h2>Creating the Right Temperature:</h2>
    <p>Keep your Money Plant in a temperature range of 65-85째F (18-29째C). Avoid exposing it to cold drafts or sudden temperature fluctuations, which can stress the plant.</p>
    
    <h2>Pruning for Growth:</h2>
    <p>To encourage new growth and maintain the plant's appearance, regularly prune yellowing or dead leaves. Pruning also prevents the plant from becoming too leggy and helps it stay compact and healthy.</p>
    
    <h2>Conclusion:</h2>
    <p>Caring for a Money Plant brings the joy of nurturing nature within your home. Following these care tips will ensure your Money Plant thrives and contributes its charm and air-purifying benefits to your indoor space. Enjoy the serenity and beauty this delightful plant brings to your daily life.</p>
